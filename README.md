### Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Matheus and I'm a beginner front-end web developer from Brazil. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently going through the Foundations course in The Odin Project and practicing on the Origin missions from Rocketseat. I've learnt about Git, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, and, previously, a bit of SQL.
- âš¡ Because of being partially deaf, I'm very interested in accessibility and usability design and have both personal and professional experience in producing closed captions and, less so, audio descriptions for the blind.

Keep tuned for more!
